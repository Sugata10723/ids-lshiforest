This is the implementation for an ICDE2017 paper with title "LSHiForest: A generic framework for fast tree isolation based ensemble anomaly analysis"


How to use this model in your project:

	1. Copy the folder 'detectors' into your working directory.

	2. Import the model via 'from detectors import LSHiForest'. Then, you can use this model for anomaly detection.

	
To run the demo:
	
python3 run_demo.py or ./run_demo.py
	
The demon will show the results of our proposed algorithms and the seminal iForest on a real data set "glass"
	
Requirement: Python 3
