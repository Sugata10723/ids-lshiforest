This demo is to show how to use the LSHiForest model for anomaly detection. LSHiForest can use several types of distance metrics.
The IsolationForest model from scikit-learn is used for comparison. Note that this model is a special case of LSHiForest with a standardized L1 distance.

The features in the 'glass.csv' data set has been preprocessed with standardization. The anomaly data instances are with label '-1', while the normal data instances are with label '1'.
